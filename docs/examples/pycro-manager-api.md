the following example may be useful to see what a pycro-manager-like
API would look like implemented on the pymmcore-plus engine.

!!! warning

    This is not presented as "suggestion", but rather as an
    educational example.  If you are considering pymmcore-plus
    for a pure-python acquisition workflow, consider using the
    `pymmcore` and `pymmcore-plus` APIs directly.
