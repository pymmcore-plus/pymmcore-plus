# Troubleshooting

## Micro-Manager directory not found

```sh
pymmcore-plus - ERROR - (_util.py:131) could not find micromanager directory. Please run 'mmcore install'
```

If you tried to create a [`pymmcore_plus.CMMCorePlus`](api/cmmcoreplus.md)
instance and got an error similar the one above, it means that pymmcore-plus was
unable to find micro-manager on on your system. Please run `mmcore install` to
install the latest version of Micro-Manager.

See the [installation](install.md#installing-micro-manager-device-adapters)
section for more details.

## Incompatible device interface version

```sh
OSError: Line 7: Device,DHub,DemoCamera,DHub
Failed to load device "DHub" from adapter module "DemoCamera" [ Failed to load device adapter "DemoCamera" from "/Users/fdrgsp/Library/Application Support/pymmcore-plus/mm/Micro-Manager-2.0.1-20210715/libmmgr_dal_DemoCamera" [ Incompatible device interface version (required = 71; found = 70) ] ]
```

If you create a [`pymmcore_plus.CMMCorePlus`](api/cmmcoreplus.md) instance and
you get an error similar the one above when trying to load a Micro-Manager
configuration file, you need to **update** your Micro-Manager device adapters
installation to the newest version (for example by running: `mmcore install`).

See the [installation](install.md#installing-micro-manager-device-adapters)
section for more details.

## Slow performance

If you are experiencing slow performance with pymmcore-plus, you can profile
your code to identify bottlenecks.  See the [profiling](profiling.md) section
for more details. If you identify a specific issue, or have a question regarding
the interpretation of the profiling results, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/pymmcore-plus/pymmcore-plus/issues/new) and
attach the profiling results if possible.
